# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Introduction to solving computational problems, including the fundamentals
  of computer programming. Topics include imperative programming constructs
  (variables, loops, conditionals, functions, recursion), basic
  object-oriented constructs (classes, objects), and some fundamental
  algorithms and data structures (dictionaries, arrays, linked lists).
  Student learn these concepts through studying the Python programming
  language.
